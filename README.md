# üõ†Ô∏è RSuite: Comprehensive Talent Management Solution

Welcome to the RSuite project ‚Äì a robust suite of tools developed to streamline your hiring and onboarding workflows. Built for Logisoft, RSuite aims to improve efficiency in managing resumes, onboarding new candidates, and enhancing resume quality to improve ATS scores.

This documentation provides an overview of the features in RInsight, ROnboard, and RSpark ‚Äì the core tools of RSuite.

### Backend and Data Processing

> **Note:** This project focuses primarily on the user interface (UI) of RSuite, but the frontend interacts with various backend services via API calls to manage and process data.

#### API Interactions

The RSuite application communicates with backend services through a set of API calls to handle various operations such as:

- **Candidate Data Management**: The UI interfaces with the backend to retrieve, update, and manage candidate data, including their personal information, employment history, and educational background.
- **AI Services**: RSuite integrates with AI-powered services like **OpenAI** (and potentially **Gemini AI** in the future) to provide features like resume analysis, suggestions for resume improvement, and keyword matching.

The frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes and returns the relevant data to be displayed on the UI. While this project doesn't include the backend implementation, it relies heavily on external services (e.g., OpenAI for resume analysis) to enrich the user experience.

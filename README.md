### Backend and Data Processing

> **Note:** This project focuses primarily on the user interface (UI) of **R**ecruit**S**marter, but the frontend interacts with various backend services via API calls to manage and process data.

#### API Interactions

This application communicates with backend services through a set of API calls to handle various operations such as:

- **Candidate Data Management**: The UI interfaces with the backend to retrieve, update, and manage candidate data, including their personal information, employment history, and educational background.
- **AI Services**: **R**ecruit**S**marter integrates with AI-powered services like **OpenAI**, **GeminiAI** and **LLama** to provide features like resume analysis, suggestions for resume improvement, keyword matching, and interview question generation.
- **Website Analysis**: Backend services handle website scraping and content analysis for RNexus functionality.
- **Form Processing**: Manages form submissions and data processing for both recruiting and sales operations in RForge.

The frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes and returns the relevant data to be displayed on the UI. While this project doesn't include the backend implementation, it relies heavily on external services (e.g., OpenAI for resume analysis and interview questions) to enrich the user experience.
